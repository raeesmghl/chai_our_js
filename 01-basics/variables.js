// four methods of declaring a variable;

// first is for declaring constant value that you are not gonna change in future (block scope);

// second is for the data that you are gonna change in future (block scope) only reassign not redeclare;

// third is an old method of declaring variables can be redeclared and reassigned (functional scoped). should not use because of its scope;

// fourth is a global scoped and is not a good way of declaring a variable;
